# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello there! I’m **Your Name**, a developer passionate about building intuitive
and accessible web experiences. This single‑page portfolio was created with
**Nextra**, a static site generator built on top of **Next.js**, and is
structured as a single MDX file for simplicity.

## About Me

highlight your skills and interests, and mention what drives you. For example,
you might talk about your favorite technologies, the types of projects you

## Projects
